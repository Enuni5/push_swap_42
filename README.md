# push_swap_42
My push_swap project at the 42 cursus. 
Description: This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, 
using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed you’ll have to manipulate various types 
of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an optimized data sorting.
